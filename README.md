# Todo App

This is a simple example of the power of Rails!
We generated the application using `rails g todo` and then used the scaffold generator (`rails g scaffold`) to quickly build all the necessary resources for User and Item.
Don't forget to run your migrations when you use generators as they will not be run for you by Rails.
Start your server with `rails s` and your console with `rails c`.
Check out your routes by typing `rails routes` or visiting `http://localhost:3000/rails/info/routes`.
